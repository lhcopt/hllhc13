The folder contains the plot of the IRs that require optics adjustment
to obtain smoother Quad strength variations during the squeeze for 
various optics scenarios.

All IRs have been checked for the following optics: 
"squeeze2", "squeeze2_lhcb","squeeze2_nomqw","squeeze_noms10","squeeze2old", "squeeze_flathv2"

Quad strength discontinuity observed mainly in IR2, but also small bumps in IR6 for
"squeeze2","squeeze2old" and "squeeze2_nomqw".
